# SQLAlchmey-Challenge
Created Juypter notebook for first half of challenge
  Used majority of instructional coding for this half from class and previous classes.  
Used code from Jupyter noted in first step to create app.py first half.  Tested code in jupyter notebook prior to putting in VS code for next Flask steps
VS code, had a lot of outside help from a friend on how to code.  This was complicated
  Used slack overflow, chatgpt to help explain logics and google as well as W3school
  Left parts in VS code my instruction told me to take out as 'commited' out items. as to just follow the homework direction, but my instructor took them out.
